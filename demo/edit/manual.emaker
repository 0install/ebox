This is a simple demonstration text editor. It doesn't do much, but it does run in a sandboxed environment where it can only read the files you ask it to open, and can only write to files you ask it to save to.

Its purpose it to clarify and test the security features of Zero Install (http://0install.net). Your goal is to make a modified version that can break out of the sandbox and access other files.
